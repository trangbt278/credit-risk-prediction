# Supervised Machine Learning - Predicting Credit Risk

Build a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub will become high risk or not. 

## Background

LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.

Use this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, compare the K Nearest Neighboor and the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

Use StandardScaler to scale the training data and compare the K Nearest Neighboor and the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier with scaled data

Use undersampling techniques to undersampling data and trying with Random Forest Classifier

Undersampling approaches:
NearMiss
CondensedNearestNeighbour
TomekLinks
EditedNearestNeighbours
OneSidedSelection
NeighbourhoodCleaningRule

Use oversampling SMOTE techniques undersampling data and trying with Random Forest Classifier
